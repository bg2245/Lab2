        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>As I crafted this HTML document, I focused on making strategic structural decisions to enhance both the visual appeal and the underlying code structure. Here are some key considerations that influenced my choices:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Semantic HTML Elements:</strong> I chose semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> to convey the meaning and structure of different parts of the document. This not only aids in accessibility but also improves the overall understanding of the content.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Consistent Styling:</strong> The use of consistent styling, such as font choices, colors, and spacing, throughout the document ensures a cohesive and professional appearance. This not only enhances readability but also contributes to a positive user experience.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Recognizing the diverse range of devices users might employ, I incorporated responsive design principles. The CSS styles adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.</li>
    
            <li><strong>Effective Use of Lists:</strong> By utilizing ordered and unordered lists, I organized information in a structured and easy-to-follow manner. This enhances the readability of sections such as education, experience, technical projects, and skills, making it convenient for readers to scan through the content.</li>
